    <title>Formatting a USB drive</title>
</head>
<body>
    
    <P>You can format a drive easily from the terminal:<br/>
    
    <code>sudo mkfs -t vfat -I /dev/sd##</code><br/>
    
    This is format it to FAT 32.<br/>
    
    <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1242017"> For more details, Refer here.</a><br/>
    
    to get the sd?? thing for your drive you can simply do:<br/>
    
    <code>df -h</code><br/>
    
    About changing the labels(That is the name of the USB drive):<br/>
    
    <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RenameUSBDrive">Ubuntu Documentation</a><br/>
       
    I will not explain the whole process(its not that big) here. It is quite clearly given in the documentation.<br/>
    
    Basically these are the steps:<br/>
    
        1. Install the labeling program<br/>
        2. Unmount the device<br/>
        3. check the current label<br/>
        4. change the label<br/>
        5. mount it again to check if the present label has been effected.<br/>
        
    Each step is clearly explained in the documentation. SO i think it would be unnecessary to go through all of it again.<br/>
    
    for FAT partitions, the list of commands is:<br/>
    
        <code>
            sudo mlabel -i /device -s ::  #to check the label<br/>
            
            sudo mlabel -i /device ::NewLabel #to add the new label<br/>
            
        </code>
