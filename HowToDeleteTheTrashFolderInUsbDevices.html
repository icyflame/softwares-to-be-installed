    <title>How to delete the Trash folder on USB drives in Linux Machines?</title>
    
    <body>
        <p>Generally, On linux systems, When a folder or a file is
        deleted from a USB drive, then it is moved to the Trash folder.
        This is not moved completely out of the memory. Moreover, due
        to this, what happens is that even the empty space can't be taken up by
        other files.<br /> <br /> So to avoid this, we must delete the trash folder.
        
        <br />This is like clearing the Recycle Bin on Windows Machine.
        <br /> We will do th following after we open the USB drive in a terminal:
        
        <code><pre>
            git init
            git status
            
            #Now you knwo the name of the Trash folder. (Some thing like .Trah-1000)
            
            rm -rf NameOfTrashFolder
        </pre></code>
        
        With this command, The files inside the folder will be deleted one-by-one and
        finally the folder itself will be deleted.
